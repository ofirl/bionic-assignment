## Remarks

ran out of time when i was getting the heatmap to look good,
so it doesn't look very good :(

but the underlying data is correct :)

also i'm still missing some specific error messages handling (like "Repository not found" instead of "Error loading...").

i'm estimating that with another hour or so i would get the heat map to look ok and i would have all the errors correctly showing
